## Memo, Feelings, Thoughts
- `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`
  - Receives `LongTensor` as a labels. **try to cast it by coding like `labels.long()`**
  - Receives `(batchsize, num classes, ...)` as model output and `(batchsize, ...)` as target tensor
  - see [official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) for more details
