## Other Activities
### Reading papers, articles, books, codes
- read [Alpha-IoU: A Family of Power Intersection over Union Losses for Bounding Box Regression](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/alpha-iou-a-family-of-power-intersection-over)
  - propose a new family of power IoU losses called α-IoU
  - \\( L_{\alpha-IoU} = 1 − IoU^\alpha + \mathcal{P}^\alpha (BBox1, BBox2) \\), where \\( \alpha > 0\\)
  - generalize existing IoU-based losses, including GIoU, DIoU, and CIoU  
    e.g.  
    \\( L_{\alpha-GIoU} = 1 − IoU^\alpha + (\frac{|C \backslash (BBox1 \bigcup BBox2)|}{|C|})^\alpha \\)  
  - proper choice of \\( \alpha \\) (i.e., \\( \alpha > 1 \\)) can help improve bbox regression accuracy
    - \\( \alpha = 3 \\) performing consistently well in most cases
