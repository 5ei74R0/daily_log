## Univ.
### courses
- **Computer Vision, CG**
    - **raster conversion**
    - *Bresenham's  Line Algorithm*
        - DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)

        code1 : simple (use floating point)
        ```Rust
        // Written in Rust
        // (x1, y1) -> (x2, y2)
        let mut x = x1;
        let mut y = y1;
        let dx = x2-x1;
        let dy = y2-y1;
        let d = dy as f64 / dx as f64;
        let mut e = d;
        for _i in 0..dx {
            coloring(x, y);
            while e >= 1.0/2.0 {
                y += 1;
                e -= 1.0;
            }
            x += 1;
            e += d;
        }
        coloring(x, y);
        ```
        code2 : improved (use only integer)
        ```Rust
        // Written in Rust
        // (x1, y1) -> (x2, y2)
        let mut x = x1;
        let mut y = y1;
        let dx = x2-x1;
        let dy = y2-y1;
        let mut e = 2 * dy - dx;
        for _i in 0..dx {
            coloring(x, y);
            while e >= 0 {
                y += 1;
                e -= 2 * dx;
            }
            x += 1;
            e += 2 * dy;
        }
        coloring(x, y);
        ```
    - **polygon**
    - *Inside Test* (check whether a point is in a polygon)
        - half-space method : sometimes make mistakes
        - odd-even test method : sometimes make mistakes
        - winding number method : nice
    - *polygon filling algorithms*
        - scan line algorithm
        - seed fill algorithm
    - *aliasing*
        - Mach bands effect
        - anti aliasing: e.g. area sampling

- **Human Interface**
    - Learn how to design UI through BAD UI

- **Data Modeling**
    - **Relational Algebra**
        - operand: relation
        - operator: **selection**, **projection**,   
          **join**, division,  
          union, intersection, difference, cartesian product
    - **SQL**
        - aggregate functions: `count, sum, avg, max, min`  
          e.g. `count(*)`, `sum(<hoge>)`
        - `group by <hoge>`

- **Network Engineering**
    - *Protocol pipelining*
        - **GBN (Go Back N)**  
          cumulative ACK  
          manages one timer to deal with timeout (packet loss)  
          much faster than Stop and wait protocol  
          one packet error make many resending  
          -> in this case, not efficient  
        - **Selective Repeat**  
          manages timers for every packet to deal with timeout (packet loss)  
          much faster than Stop and wait protocol  

### homework
- **Data Modeling**
    - create a tiny relational database
    - Today, modeled RDB from the Entity Relationship Diagram & began to write the report
