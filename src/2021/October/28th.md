go to the [previous day](./27th.md) | go to the [next day](./29th.md)

## Univ.
- visited the journal club

### courses
#### *Programming Methodologies*
- Representation Invariant
  - should be true at the beginning and end of method
  - check it by assertion, special method, or code review
- abstract function

#### *OS*
- scheduling
  - basic theory
    - fairness
    - terms: job, job arrival, job start, job completion
    - turnaround / response
    - FIFO → SJF (Shortest Job First) : decrease average of turnaround time
    - STCF : SJF with preemption, bad response
    - Round-Robin : good response, cannot achieve best turnaround
    - CPU-bound, CPU-intensive vs I/O-bound, I/O-intensive
  - basic ideas for the practical scheduler
    - MLFQ (Multi-level Feedback Queue)  
      interactive process : decrease response time  
      non-interactive process : decrease turnaround time  
      Round-Robin + priority of each process  
      (priority is dynamically change)  
      I/O-intensive : high priority
      CPU-intensive : low priority  
    - starvation  
      to avoid it..  
      Priority Boost, Aging

- Bayes theorem
- multivariate normal distribution
