## Univ.
### courses
- **Visual computing**
    - frequency of an image
    - spatial filtering, PSF(Point Spread Function), convolution
    - 2D-DFT & 2D-iDFT
    - frequency filtering
    - sampling theory
        - maximum frequency < Nyquist frequency
          -> avoid aliasing
    - re-sampling

- **Human Interface**

- **Data Modeling**
    - modeling the Entity Relationship Diagram
    - modeling the RDB from Entity Relationship Diagram

- **Network Engineering**
    - Transport Layer protocols
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) : connection-oriented
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) : connection-less
    - how to achieve the reliable data transfer above the unreliable data transfer?
        - rdt1.0 ~ rdt3.0
        - deal with error & packet loss
        - stop and wait
        - checksum
        - ARQ (ACK, ~~NAK(~rdt2.1)~~)
        - sequence number
        - time out
    - rdt3.0 is slow -> next: Protocol pipelining

### homework
- [x] **Visual Computing**
    - why should we use the low pass filter in down sampling?  
      -> Nyquist frequency becomes smaller than maximum frequency because of down sampling.  
      -> then aliasing occurs & the image transforms by mistake.  
      -> we should erase the high frequency in the original image before down sampling.  
      -> we can do this by using the low pass filter.
